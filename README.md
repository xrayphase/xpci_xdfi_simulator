Project title: Multi-Layer X-ray Phase-Contrast and Dark-Field Imaging Simulator

Project description: X-ray phase-contrast imaging (XPCI) exploits X-ray refraction caused by local variations in the electron density. X-ray dark-field imaging (XDFI) exploits the scramble of coherent wavefronts due to sub-structure on the micrometer scale. In this project, we develop a wave optics simulator for XPCI and XDFI using a multi-layer propagation method and the 4D cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom.
